## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OkayJosh/compliance
   cd compliance
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

##### You can use venv (Python's built-in virtual environment module) to create a virtual environment.

   ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
   ```

For Windows:

```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **install the requirements packages for the project:**

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your SUMSUB API credentials and any other required environment variables:**

```makefile
SUMSUB_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token
SUMSUB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
SUMSUB_TEST_BASE_URL=https://api.sumsub.com
```

5. **Run database migrations:**

Apply the migrations to set up your database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
6. **Start the application**

```bash

python manage.py runserver
```

#### You should see output indicating that the server is running, usually at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

### API Endpoints
